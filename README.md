# Rushil Mallarapu - Senior Thesis

_NOTE: `5-litref.typ` is fake chapter - just there for my sake to organize writing for chapter 1._

# How to build

Main file is `main.typ`.

To build (with live reloading), either run `build.fish` if you have fish, or run
```sh
$ typst watch main.typ --font-path fonts/
```

## Organization:
- `fonts/`: Directory of fonts.

## TODO:
- In Ch. 3 and 4, change $p_"solve"$, etc to have superscripts for (1) poly, (2) low coord degree (LCD), and (3) hat algorithms $hat(p)^lcd _"solve"

## Outline:

# Introduction

- What's the problem
- What are practical applications
- Theoretical applications
    - Statistical physics - phase transition behavior
    - Computer science - NP hardness

## History of Algorithmic Challenges

- 

- Worst case: what's possible
- Worst case algorithms
- Average case: what's possible
- Average case algorithms


## Statistical-to-Computational Gaps and Average Case Hardness

- Average case hardness - evidence?

- Overlap Gap Property: algorithmic hardness is determined by the geometry of the random landscape of solutions.

Recent work of Gamarnik and Kizildag has established the existence or failure of the OGP in 

## Our Contributions

We consider low degree algorithms, as explained in ch 2 ()

## Notation and Conventions


- Statistical to computational gaps as evidence of average case hardness.
- Overlap gap property

- Low degree heuristic
