= Introduction

Suppose that we have $N$ items, each with associated weights.
How should we divide these items into two groups so that the sum of their weights is as close as possible?
Or, is it possible to divide these items into two groups such that the absolute difference of the sums of their weights is below a certain threshold?
This question is known as the _number partitioning problem (NPP)_,
and has been a subject of fascination in statistics, physics, and computer science since its proposal in 1969 @grahamBoundsMultiprocessingTiming1969.

Formally, let $g_1,dots,g_N$ be $N$ real numbers.
The NPP is the problem of finding the subset $A$ of $[N]:={1,2,dots,N}$ which minimizes the discrepancy
$ abs(sum_(i in A) g_i - sum_(i in.not A) g_i). $
Alternatively, identify the instance $g_1,dots,g_N$ with a point $g in RR^N$.
Then, choosing a subset $A subset.eq [N]$ is equivalent to choosing a point $x$ in the $N$-dimensional binary hypercube $Sigma_N := {plus.minus 1}^N$, where $x_i = +1$ is the same as including $i in A$.
The discrepancy of $x$ is now $abs(inn(g,x))$, and solving the NPP means finding the $x$ minimizing this discrepancy:
$ min_(x in Sigma_N) abs(inn(g,x)). $ <eq_npp_first>

Rephrased as a decision problem -- whether there exists a subset $A subeq [N]$ (or a point $x in Sigma_N$) such that the discrepancy is zero, or sufficiently small -- the NPP is NP-complete; this can be shown by reduction from the subset sum problem.
In fact, the NPP is one of the six basic NP-complete problems of Garey and Johnson, and of those, the only one involving numbers @gareyComputersIntractabilityGuide1979[#sym.section 3.1].

// practical applications

Finding "good" solutions to this problem has a number of practical applications.
For instance, the NPP and MWNPP
#footnote[That is, the _multiway number partitioning problem (MWNPP)_, in which we want to partition $g_1,dots,g_N$ into $M$ subsets such that the within-subset sums are mutually close; what "mutually close" means precisely varies across the literature.]
were first formulated by Graham, who considered it in the context of multiprocessor scheduling: dividing a group of tasks with known runtimes across a pool of processors so as to minimize one core being overworked while others stall @grahamBoundsMultiprocessingTiming1969.
Later work by Coffman, Garey, and Johnson, as well as Tsai, looked at utilizing algorithms for the NPP for designing multiprocessor schedulers or large integrated circuits @coffmanjr.ApplicationBinPackingMultiprocessor1978 @tsaiAsymptoticAnalysisAlgorithm1992.
Coffman and Lueker also write on how the NPP can be applied as a framework for allocating material stocks, such as steel coils in factories, paintings in museums, or advertisements in newspapers @coffmanProbabilisticAnalysisPacking1991.

// application: randomized control trials

One particularly important application of the NPP in statistics comes from the design of _randomized controlled trials_.
Consider $N$ individuals, each with a set of covariate information $g_i in RR^d$.
Then the problem is to divide them into a treatment group (denoted $A_+$) and a control group (denoted $A_-$), subject each to different conditions, and evaluate the responses.
In order for such a trial to be accurate, it is necessary to ensure that the covariates across both groups are roughly the same.
In our notation, this equates to finding an $A_+$ (with $A_- := [N] without A_+$) minimizing
$
  min_(A_+ subeq [N]) norm( sum_(i in A_+) g_i - sum_(i in A_-) g_i )_infinity.
$ <eq_def_vbp>
This extension of the NPP is often termed the _vector balancing problem (VBP)_, and many algorithms for solving the NPP/VBP come from designing such randomized controlled trials @kriegerNearlyRandomDesigns2019 @harshawBalancingCovariatesRandomized2023.

// applications: cryptography

On the other hand, in 1976, Merkle and Hellman devised one of the earliest public key cryptography schemes, deriving its hardness from their belief that a variant of the NPP was computationally difficult to solve -- at the time, it was not yet known whether the NPP was NP-complete or not @merkleHidingInformationSignatures1978.
Their proposal was for the receiver, say Alice, to generate as a public key $N$ natural numbers $(a_1,dots,a_N)$, with $N$ typically around 100 and each $a_i$ around 200 bits long.
To encrypt a $N$-bit message $x = (x_1,dots,x_N) in {0,1}^N$, the sender, say Bob, could compute
$ b := sum_(i in N) a_i x_i $
and send the ciphertext $b$ to Alice.
Any eavesdropper would know $a_1,dots,a_N$, as well as $b$, and decrypting the message involved finding a subset of the $a_i$ adding up to $b$.
This is known as the _knapsack problem_, which is NP-complete, as can be shown by restriction to the NPP @gareyComputersIntractabilityGuide1979[3.2.1(6)].
However, such NP-completeness is only a worst-case hardness guarantee; Merkle and Hellman's scheme involved Alice choosing $a_1,dots,a_N$ by cryptographically scrambling a sequence $(a'_1,dots,a'_N)$ for which solving the NPP was easy, enabling the receiver to practically decrypt the message $x$ from the ciphertext $b$.
In 1984, Shamir -- one of the developers of the RSA cryptosystem still in use today -- showed that one could exploit this public key generation process to reduce the "hard" knapsack problem to one which was solvable in polynomial time, rendering the Merkle-Hellman scheme insecure @shamirPolynomialTimeAlgorithm1982.
While today, Merkle-Hellman is but a footnote in the history of cryptography, it demonstrates the importance of looking beyond worst-case hardness and expanding complexity theory to describe the difficulty of the average problem instance.

// physics and phase transition

Another major source of interest in the NPP, as well as potential explanations for when it is hard, come from statistical physics.
In the 1980s, Derrida introduced the eponymous _random energy model (REM)_, a simplified example of a spin glass in which, unlike the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick or other $p$-spin glass models, the possible energy levels are independent of each other @derridaRandomEnergyModelLimit1980 @derridaRandomenergyModelExactly1981 @baukeNumberPartitioningRandom2004.
Despite this simplicity, this model made possible heuristic analyses of the Parisi theory for mean field spin glasses, and it was suspected that arbitrary random discrete systems would locally behave like the REM @baukeUniversalityLevelStatistics2004 @kistlerDerridasRandomEnergy2014.
The NPP was the first system for which this local REM conjecture was shown @borgsProofLocalREM2009 @borgsProofLocalREM2009a.
In addition, in the case when the $g_i$ are independently chosen uniformly over ${1,2,...,2^M}$, Gent and Walsh conjectured that the hardness of finding perfect partitions (i.e., with discrepancy zero if $sum_i g_i$ is even, and one else) was controlled by the parameter $kappa := m/n$ @gentAnalysisHeuristicsNumber1998 @gentPhaseTransitionsAnnealed2000.
Mertens soon gave a nonrigorous statistical mechanics argument suggesting the existence of a phase transition from $kappa < 1$ to $kappa > 1$; that is, while solutions exist in the low $kappa$ regime, they stop existing in the high $kappa$ regime @mertensPhysicistsApproachNumber2001.
It was also observed that this phase transition coincided with the empirical onset of computational hardness for typical algorithms, and Borgs, Chayes, and Pittel proved the existence of this phase transition soon after @hayesEasiestHardProblem2002 @borgsPhaseTransitionFinitesize2001.

// algorithmic gap

== The Statistical-to-Computational Gap

Many problems involving searches over random combinatorial structures (i.e., throughout high-dimensional statistics) exhibit a statistical-to-computational gap: the optimal values which are known to exist via non-constructive, probabilistic methods are far better than those achievable by state-of-the-art algorithms.
In the pure optimization setting, examples such gaps are found in random constraint satisfaction @mezardClusteringSolutionsRandom2005 @achlioptasAlgorithmicBarriersPhase2008 @kothariSumSquaresLower2017, finding maximal independent sets in sparse random graphs @gamarnikLimitsLocalAlgorithms2014 @coja-oghlanIndependentSetsRandom2015, the largest submatrix problem @gamarnikFindingLargeSubmatrix2016 @gamarnikOverlapGapProperty2021a, and the $p$-spin and diluted $p$-spin models @gamarnikOverlapGapProperty2019 @chenSuboptimalityLocalAlgorithms2019.
These gaps also arise in various "planted" models, such as matrix or tensor PCA @berthetComputationalLowerBounds2013 @lesieurMMSEProbabilisticLowrank2015 @lesieurPhaseTransitionsSparse2015 @hopkinsTensorPrincipalComponent2015 @hopkinsPowerSumofsquaresDetecting2017 @arousAlgorithmicThresholdsTensor2020,
high-dimensional linear regression @gamarnikSparseHighDimensionalLinear2019 @gamarnikHighDimensionalRegressionBinary2019,
or the infamously hard planted clique problem @jerrumLargeCliquesElude1992 @deshpandeImprovedSumofSquaresLower2015 @mekaSumofsquaresLowerBounds2015 @barakNearlyTightSumofSquares2016 @gamarnikLandscapePlantedClique2019.
These indicate that these problems are "hard" in a way that goes beyond being NP; algorithms fail even on average-case instances.

The NPP is no exception: despite its apparent simplicity, its persistent importance in the random optimization literature comes from the shocking width of its associated statistical-to-computational gap.
On the statistical side, the landmark result here is by Karmarkar et al., who showed that when the $g_i$ are i.i.d.random variables, with distribution sufficiently nice,
#footnote[Specifically, having bounded density and finite fourth moment.] <foot_nice>
then the minimum discrepancy of @eq_npp_first is $Theta(sqrt(N) 2^(-N))$ with high probability as $N to infinity$ @karmarkarProbabilisticAnalysisOptimum1986.
Their result also extends to _even partitions_, where the sizes of each subset is equal (i.e., for $N$ even), worsening only to $Theta( N 2^(-N))$.
Yet the best known algorithms cannot achieve discrepancies close to this in polynomial time.

A first approach to the NPP, often termed the _greedy heuristic_, would be to sort the $N$ inputs, place the largest in one subset, and place the subsequent largest numbers in the subset with the smaller total running sum.
This takes $O(N log N)$ time (due to the sorting step), but achieves a discrepancy of $O(N^(-1))$, extremely far off from the statistical optimum @mertensEasiestHardProblem2003.
More recently, Krieger et al. developed an algorithm achieving a discrepancy of $O(N^(-2))$, but in exchange for this poor performance, their algorithm solves for a balanced partition, making it useful for randomized control trials @kriegerNearlyRandomDesigns2019.

The true breakthrough towards the statistical optimum came from Karmarkar and Karp, whose algorithm produced a discrepancy of $O(N^(-alpha log N))=2^(-O(log^2 N))$ with high probability.
Their algorithm is rather complicated, involving randomization and a resampling step to make their analysis tractable, but their main contribution is the _differencing heuristic_ @karmarkarDifferencingMethodSet1983.
The idea is as follows: if $S$ is a list of items, then putting $g,g' in S$ in opposite partitions is the same as removing $g$ and $g'$ and adding $abs(g-g')$ back to $S$.
Karmarkar and Karp propose two simpler algorithms based on this heuristic, the _partial differencing method (PDM)_ and _largest differencing method (LDM)_, which they conjectured could also achieve discrepancies of $O(N^(-alpha log N))$.
In both, the items are first sorted, and the differencing is performed on the pairs of the largest and second largest items.
However, in PDM, the remainders are ignored until all original numbers have been differenced, and then are resorted and repartitioned, while LDM reinserts the remainder in sorted order at each step; in any case, both algorithms are thus polynomial in $N$.
Lueker soon disproved the claim that PDM could achieve the Karmarkar-Karp discrepancy, showing that when $g_i$ were i.i.d. Uniform on $[0,1]$, then the expected discrepancy was $Theta(N^(-1))$, no better than the greedy algorithm @luekerNoteAveragecaseBehavior1987.
However, for $g_i$ i.i.d. Uniform or even Exponential, Yakir confirmed that LDM could achieve the performance of the original differencing algorithm, proving that its expected discrepancy was $N^(-Theta(log N))$ @yakirDifferencingAlgorithmLDM1996.
The constant $alpha$ was later estimated for LDM to be $alpha=1/(2 ln 2)$, via nonrigorous calculations @boettcherAnalysisKarmarkarKarpDifferencing2008.

Of course, at its most basic level, the NPP is a search problem over $2^N$ possible partitions, so given more and more time, an appropriate algorithm could keep improving its partition until it achieved the global optimum.
To this degree, Korf developed alternatives known as the _complete greedy_ and _complete Karmarkar-Karp_ algorithms which, if run for exponentially long time, can find the globally optimal partition @korfApproximateOptimalSolutions1995 @korfCompleteAnytimeAlgorithm1998.
This algorithm was later extended to multiway number partitioning @korfMultiwayNumberPartitioning2009.
See also Michiels et al. for extensions to balanced multiway partitioning @michielsPerformanceRatiosDifferencing2003.

For the multidimensional VBP case, Spencer showed in 1985 that the worse-case discrepancy of the VBP was at most $6sqrt(N)$ for $d=N$ and $norm(g_i)_infinity <= 1$ for all $1 <= i <= N$ @spencerSixStandardDeviations1985.
However, his argument is an application of the probabilistic method, and does not construct such a solution.
In the average case, Turner et al. proved that, under similar regularity assumptions on the $g_i$,@foot_nice the minimum discrepancy is $Theta(sqrt(N) 2^(-N slash d))$ for all $d <= o(N)$, with high probability @turnerBalancingGaussianVectors2020.
For the regime $delta=Theta(N)$, Aubin et al. conjecture that there exists an explicit function $c(delta)$ such that for $delta > 0$, the discrepancy in the $d=delta N$ regime is $c(delta) sqrt(N)$ with high probability @aubinStorageCapacitySymmetric2019.
To this end, Turner et al. also showed that for $d <= delta N$, one can achieve $O(sqrt(N) 2^(-1 slash delta))$ with probability at least 99% @turnerBalancingGaussianVectors2020.
On the algorithmic side, they generalized the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm to VBP, which, for $2 <= d = O(sqrt( log N))$ finds partitions with discrepancy $2^(-Theta(log^2 N slash d))$, reproducing the gap of classical Karmarkar-Karp.
On the other hand, in the superlinear regime $d >= 2 N$, this average-case discrepancy worsens to $tilde(O)(sqrt(N log(2d slash N)))$ @chandrasekaranIntegerFeasibilityRandom2013.
Yet, many proposed algorithms can achieve similar discrepancies, which is believed to be optimal for $d >= N$ @spencerSixStandardDeviations1985 @bansalConstructiveAlgorithmsDiscrepancy2010 @lovettConstructiveDiscrepancyMinimization2012 @rothvossConstructiveDiscrepancyMinimization2016.

== Algorithmic Hardness and Landscape Obstructions

Classical algorithmic complexity theory -- involving classes such as P, NP, etc. -- is poorly suited to describing the hardness of random optimization problems, as these classes are based on the worst-case performance of available algorithms.
In many cases, the statistically possible performance of solutions to random instances of these NP-complete problems will be far better than the worst-case analysis would suggest.
How then, can we extend complexity theory to describe problems which, like the NPP, are hard on average?
Along with the aforementioned statistical-to-computational gaps, the past two decades of research have shown that many methods can provide evidence of this average-case hardness, such as the failure of Markov chain algorithms
@jerrumLargeCliquesElude1992 @gamarnikAlgorithmicObstructionsRandom2021b @huangStrongLowDegree2025,
the failure of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms
@zdeborovaStatisticalPhysicsInference2016 @bandeiraNotesComputationaltostatisticalGaps2018,
or lower bounding performance against the sum-of-squares hierarchy or the statistical query model
@hopkinsTensorPrincipalComponent2015 @hopkinsPowerSumofsquaresDetecting2017 @raghavendraHighdimensionalEstimationSumofsquares2019 @barakNearlyTightSumofSquares2016 @kearnsEfficientNoisetolerantLearning1998 @diakonikolasStatisticalQueryLower2017 @feldmanStatisticalAlgorithmsLower2016.

One particularly interesting approach is to prove average-case to worst-case reductions: if one shows that a polynomial-time algorithm for solving random instances could be used to design a polynomial-time algorithm for arbitrary instances, then assuming the problem was known to be in NP, it can be concluded that no such polynomial-time algorithm for the average case can exist @gamarnikOverlapGapProperty2021.
This method has been used to show hardness for sparse PCA, detecting planted independent subgraphs, and more by reducing to the random planted clique problem @berthetComputationalLowerBounds2013 @brennanOptimalAverageCaseReductions2019 @brennanReducibilityComputationalLower2019.
To this extent, Hoberg et al. provided such evidence of hardness for the NPP by showing that a polynomial-time approximation oracle achieving discrepancies around $O(2^sqrt(N))$ could give polynomial-time approximations for Minkowski's problem, the latter of which is known to be hard @hobergNumberBalancingHard2016.
More recently, Vafa and Vaikuntanathan showed that the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm's performance was nearly tight, assuming the worst-case hardness of the shortest vector problem on lattices @vafaSymmetricPerceptronsNumber2025.
Other conjectures suggested that the onset of algorithmic hardness was related to phase transitions in the solution landscapes, something which has been shown for random $k$-SAT, but this fails to describe hardness for optimization problems.

A more recent and widely successful approach is based on analyzing the geometry of the solution landscape.
Many "hard" random optimization problems have a certain disconnectivity property, known as the _overlap gap property (OGP)_ @gamarnikOverlapGapProperty2021.
Roughly, this means there exist $0 <= nu_1 < nu_2$ such that, for every two near-optimal states $x,x'$ for a particular instance $g$ of the problem either have $d(x,x')<nu_1$ or $d(x,x') > nu_2$.
That is, pairs of solutions are either close to each other, or much further away -- the condition that $nu_1 < nu_2$ ensures that the "diameter" of solution clusters is much smaller than the separation between these clusters.
#footnote[This is called the "overlap" gap property because, in the literature, this is often described in terms of the inner product of the solutions, as opposed to the distance between them.]
Beyond ruling out the existence of pairs of near solutions with $d(x,x') in [nu_1,nu_2]$, a common extension is the _multioverlap OGP ($m$-OGP)_: given an ensemble of $m$ strongly correlated instances, there do not exist $m$-tuples of near solutions all equidistant from each other.
This extension is often useful to lower the "threshold" at which the OGP starts to appear.
Once established, the OGP and $m$-OGP, which is intrinsic to the problem, can be used to rule out the success of wide classes of stable algorithms @achlioptasSolutionSpaceGeometryRandom2006 @achlioptasAlgorithmicBarriersPhase2008 @mezardClusteringSolutionsRandom2005 @gamarnikLimitsLocalAlgorithms2014 @gamarnikLowDegreeHardnessRandom2020 @rahmanLocalAlgorithmsIndependent2017 @weinOptimalLowDegreeHardness2020.

For the NPP, it was expected for decades that the "brittleness" of the solution landscape would be a central barrier in finding successful algorithms to close the statistical-to-computational gap. Mertens wrote in 2001 that any local heuristics, which only looked at fractions of the domain, would fail to outperform random search @mertensPhysicistsApproachNumber2001[#sym.section 4.3].
This was backed up by the failure of many algorithms based on locally refining Karmarkar-Karp-optimal solutions, such as simulated annealing
@arguelloRandomizedMethodsNumber1996 @storerProblemSpaceLocal1996 @johnsonOptimizationSimulatedAnnealing1989b @johnsonOptimizationSimulatedAnnealing1991 @alidaeeNewModelingSolution2005.
To that end, more recent approaches for algorithmic development are rooted in more global heuristics
@kraticaTwoMetaheuristicApproaches2014 @corusArtificialImmuneSystems2019 @santucciImprovedMemeticAlgebraic2021,
and some of the most interesting directions in algorithmic development for the NPP comes from quantum computing: as this is outside our scope, we encourage the interested reader to consult @asproniAccuracyMinorEmbedding2020 @wenOpticalExperimentalSolution2023.
The main result to this effect comes from Gamarnik and Kızıldağ, who proved that for $m$ of constant order, the $m$-OGP for NPP held for discrepancies of $2^(-Theta(N))$ (i.e., the statistical optimum), but was absent for smaller discrepancies of $2^(-E_N)$ with $omega(1) <= E_N <= o(N)$ @gamarnikAlgorithmicObstructionsRandom2021b.
They do show, however, that the $m$-OGP in for $E_N >= omega(sqrt(N log N))$ could be recovered for $m$ superconstant.
This allowed them to prove that for $epsilon in (0,1 slash 5)$, no stable algorithm (suitably defined) could find solutions with discrepancy $2^(-E_N)$ for $omega(N log^(-1/5 + epsilon) N) <= E_N <= o(N)$ @gamarnikAlgorithmicObstructionsRandom2021b[Thm. 3.2].
These results point to the efficacy of using landscape obstructions to show algorithmic hardness for the NPP, which we will take advantage of in @section_hardness.

== Our Results <section_intro_results>

In this thesis, we use a variant of the OGP, which we term a _conditional landscape obstruction_, to prove low degree algorithmic hardness guarantees for the NPP at a range of discrepancy scales.
Our obstruction is based on the observation that given a solution to one instance of the NPP, it is impossible to pin down the location of any solution to a strongly correlated instance, which prevents suitably stable algorithms from traversing the solution landscape.
This is the "brittleness" of the NPP -- even small changes in the instance drastically reshape the geometry of the solutions.

To start, let us formalize our terminology for the NPP.

#definition[
  Let $g in RR^N$ be an instance of the NPP, and let $x in Sigma_N$.
  The _energy_ of $x$ is
  $
    E(x;g) := - log_2 abs(inn(g,x)).
  $
  The _solution set $Soln(g)$_ is the set of all $x in Sigma_N$ that have energy at least $E$, i.e., that satisfy
  $
    abs(inn(g,x)) <= 2^(-E).
  $ // <eq_npp>
] <def_npp_statement>

Observe here that minimizing the discrepancy $abs(inn(g,x))$ corresponds to maximizing the energy $E(x;g)$.
This terminology is motivated by the statistical physics literature, wherein random optimization problems are often reframed as energy maximization over a random landscape @mertensPhysicistsApproachNumber2001.
We further know that the _statistically optimal energy level_ is $E=Theta(N)$, while the best _computational energy level_ (achievable in polynomial time) is $E=Theta(log^2 N)$.

For our purposes, an algorithm is a function $alg colon RR^N to Sigma_N$ mapping instances $g$ to partitions $x$.
We will discuss extensions to randomized algorithms (which can depend on a random seed $omega$ independent of $g$) and to $RR^N$-valued algorithms (which can be forced to give outputs on $Sigma_N$ via rounding) in later sections, but for our main analysis, considering deterministic $Sigma_N$-valued algorithms will suffice.
In particular, we consider the class of so-called _low degree algorithms_, given by either low degree polynomials or by functions with low _coordinate degree_.
Compared to analytically-defined classes of stable algorithms (e.g. Lipschitz, etc.), these algorithms have an algebraic structure making them amenable to precise stability analysis.
In addition, the _low degree heuristic_ suggests that degree $D$ algorithms (in either sense) are believed to serve as the simplest representatives for the class of $e^(tilde(O)(D))$-time algorithms @hopkinsStatisticalInferenceSum2018.
This is a reasonable expectation for number partitioning, enabling us to translate our results into heuristic runtime bounds.

Our results show _strong low degree hardness_ for the NPP at energy levels between the statistical and computational thresholds, in the sense of Huang and Sellke @huangStrongLowDegree2025.

#definition[Strong Low Degree Hardness @huangStrongLowDegree2025[Def. 3]][
  A sequence of random search problems, that is, a $N$-indexed sequence of random input vectors
  $ g_N in RR^(d_N) $
  and random subsets
  $ S_N = S_N (g_N) subeq Sigma_N $
  exhibits _strong low degree hardness (SLDH) up to degree $D <= o(D_N)$_ if, for all sequences of degree $o(D_N)$ algorithms $alg_N colon (g,omega) mapsto x$ with $EE norm(alg(y_N))^2 <= O(N)$, we have
  $ PP(alg_N (g_N,omega) in S_N) <= o(1). $
] <def_sldh>

There are two related notions of degree which we want to consider in @def_sldh.
The first is traditional polynomial degree, applicable for algorithms given in each coordinate by low degree polynomial functions of the inputs. In this case, we show

#theorem[Results of @section_hardness_poly][
  The NPP exhibits SLDH for degree $D$ polynomial algorithms, for
  #enum(
    [$D <= o(exp_2(delta N slash 2))$ when $E = delta N$ for $delta > 0$;],
    [$D <= o(exp_2(E slash 4))$ when $omega(log N) <= E <= o(N)$.],
  )
] <thrm_sldh_poly_informal>

Under the low degree heuristic, this suggests that polynomial algorithms require double exponential time to achieve the statistical optimal discrepancy; given that brute-force search requires exponential time, this is strong evidence that polynomial algorithms are poor models for the NPP.

Thus, we turn to the second, more general notion of _coordinate degree_: a function $f colon RR^N to RR$ has coordinate degree $D$ if it can be expressed as a linear combination of functions depending on combinations of no more than $D$ coordinates.
While related to polynomial degree, this enables us to consider a far broader class of algorithms, in which case we show

#theorem[Results of @section_hardness_lcd][
  The NPP exhibits SLDH for coordinate degree $D$ algorithms, for
  #enum(
    [$D <= o(N)$ when $E = delta N$ for $delta > 0$;],
    [$D <= o(E slash log^2 N)$ when $omega(log^2 N) <= E <= o(N)$.],
  )
] <thrm_sldh_lcd_informal>

These results are likely to be the best-possible under the low degree heuristic, which we discuss in @rmk_optimal. In particular, the energy-degree tradeoff of $D <= tilde(o)(E)$ implies finding solutions with energy $E$ requires time $e^(tilde(Omega)(E))$, and as we'll show, it is possible to achieve such discrepancies via a restricted exponential-time search. Given this, our method produces a sharp energy-runtime tradeoff, indicating there are no nontrivial algorithms that save more than a polylogarithmic factor in the runtime exponent over brute-force search.
Overall, our approach towards @thrm_sldh_poly_informal and @thrm_sldh_lcd_informal suggest that in the case of problems with brittle solution geometry, conditional landscape obstructions are an extremely powerful tool for proving algorithmic hardness.

The rest of the thesis is organized as follows. We review the low degree heuristic and work with low coordinate degree algorithms in @section_algorithm. In particular, we provide a self-contained introduction to coordinate degree and related decompositions of $L^2$ functions in @section_algorithm_es.
Our main results then constitute @section_hardness; after giving an overview of our proof strategy, we prove @thrm_sldh_poly_informal in @section_hardness_poly, and likewise prove @thrm_sldh_lcd_informal in @section_hardness_lcd.
We conclude in @section_rounding by extending our results to the case of $RR^N$-valued algorithms and finish by discussing directions for future research.

== Conventions and Fundamentals

We use the standard Bachmann-Landau notations $o(dot), O(dot), omega(dot), Omega(dot), Theta(dot)$, taken in the limit $N to infinity$. In addition, we write $f(N) asymp g(N)$, $f(N) << g(N)$, or $f(N) >> g(N)$ when $f(N)=Theta(g(N))$, $f(N) = o(g(N))$, or $f(N) = omega(g(N))$, respectively.

We write $[N] := {1,dots,N}$. If $S subeq [N]$, then $overline(S) := [N] without S$ is the complimentary set of indices. If $x in RR^N$ and $S subeq [N]$, then $x_S$ is the vector with
$ (x_S)_i := cases(x_i #h(2em) &i in S\,, 0 &"else.") $
In particular, for $x,y in RR^N$, $inn(x_S, y) = inn(x,y_S) = inn(x_S,y_S)$.

On $RR^N$, we write $norm(dot)$ for the Euclidean norm, and $B(x,r) := { y in RR^N : norm(y-x) < r}$ for the Euclidean ball of radius $r$ around $x$.
We use $Normal(mu,sigma^2)$ to denote the scalar Normal distribution with given mean and variance. In addition, we write "i.i.d." to mean independently and identically distributed, and "r.v." to mean random variable (or random vector, if it is clear from context).

Throughout the remainder of this thesis, we will make use of the following general results:

// Normal probability lemma

#lemma[Normal Small-Probability Estimate][
  Let $E,sigma^2 > 0$, and suppose $Z | mu ~ Normal(mu,sigma^2)$. Then
  $
    PP(abs(Z) <= 2^(-E) | mu) <= exp_2 (-E - 1 / 2 log_2 (sigma^2) + O(1)).
  $ <eq_normal_smallprob>
] <lem_normal_smallprob>
#proof[
  Observe that conditional on $mu$, the distribution of $Z$ is bounded as
  $
    phi_(Z|mu) (z) <= 1 / sqrt(2 pi sigma^2) e^(-(z-mu)^2 / (2 sigma^2)) <= (2 pi sigma^2)^(-1 slash 2).
  $
  Integrating over $abs(z)<= 2^(-E)$ then gives @eq_normal_smallprob, via
  $
    PP(abs(Z) <= 2^(-E)) = integral_(abs(z) <= 2^(-E)) (2 pi sigma^2)^(-1 slash 2) dif z <= 2^(-E - 1 / 2 log_2 (2 pi sigma^2) + 1). #qedhere
  $
]

Note that @eq_normal_smallprob is a decreasing function of $sigma^2$. Thus, if there exists $gamma$ with $sigma^2 >= gamma > 0$, then @eq_normal_smallprob is bounded by $exp_2(-E - log_2(gamma) slash 2 + O(1))$.

// Chernoff-Hoeffding bound

#lemma[Chernoff-Hoeffding][
  Suppose that $K <= N slash 2$, and let $h(x)=-x log_2 (x) - (1-x) log_2 (x)$ be the binary entropy function. Then, for $p := K slash N$,
  $ sum_(k <= K) binom(N,k) <= exp_2 (N h(p)) <= exp_2 (2 N p log_2 (1 / p)). $

#proof[
  Consider a $Bin(N,p)$ random variable $S$. Summing its PMF from $0$ to $K$, we have
  $
    1 >= PP(S <= K) = sum_(k <= K) binom(N,k) p^k (1-p)^(N-k) >= sum_(k<= K) binom(N,k) p^K (1-p)^(N-K).
  $
  The last inequality follows by multiplying each term by $(p slash (1-p))^(K-k)<=1$. Rearranging gives
  $
    sum_(k <= K) binom(N,k) &<= p^(-K) (1-p)^(-(N-K)) \ &= exp_2 (-K log_2 (p) - (N-K) log_2 (1-p)) \
    &= exp_2 (N dot (-K / N log_2 (p) - ((N-K) / N) log_2 (1-p))) \
    &= exp_2 (N dot (-p log_2 (p) - (1-p) log_2 (1-p)) ) = exp_2 (N h(p)).
  $
  The final equality then follows from the bound $h(p) <= 2 p log_2 (1 slash p)$ for $p <= 1 slash 2$.
