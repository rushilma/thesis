  Finding good solutions to the _number partitioning problem (NPP)_ -- that is, finding a partition of a set of $N$ numbers to minimize the discrepancy between the sums of the two subsets -- is a well-studied optimization problem, with applications to statistics, physics, and computer science.
  Along with having numerous practical applications in the design of randomized control trials and processor scheduling,
  the NPP is famous for posessing a _statistical-to-computational gap_:
  assuming the $N$ numbers to be partitioned are i.i.d. standard Normal random variables, the optimal discrepancy is $2^(-Theta(N))$ with high probability, but the best polynomial-time algorithms only find solutions with a discrepancy of $2^(- Theta(log^2 N))$.
  This gap is a common feature in optimization problems over random combinatorial structures, and indicates the need for a theory of computational complexity beyond worst-case analysis.

  In this thesis, we prove a strong form of algorithmic hardness for the number partitioning problem, aiming to establish that this statistical-to-computational gap is an intrinsic feature of the NPP.
  We study _low degree algorithms_, as they provide both tunable stability behavior and are tractable models for a broad class of algorithms, under the widely successful _low degree heuristic_.
  Then, we establish a _brittleness property_ on the geometry of the solution set, which ensures that stable algorithms are unable to efficiently traverse this random landscape.
  By combining these notions, we are able to show _strong low degree hardness_, in that low degree algorithms will fail to find good solutions with high probability.
  In addition, while we show that low degree polynomial algorithms are structurally ill-suited to the NPP, our results for the more general class of _low coordinate degree algorithms_ demonstrate a sharp tradeoff between algorithmic runtime (vis-à-vis algorithmic complexity) and solution discrepancy, which our analysis suggests is optimal.

  Finally, we establish a _repulsion property_, giving a precise tradeoff between the the discrepancy of a solution to a fixed instance and its distance to other solutions.
  We then leverage this to show that any algorithm fed through a truly randomized rounding scheme will fail to find solutions with high probability.
  This work demonstrates the effectiveness of using landscape properties to address questions about algorithmic hardness, and suggests interesting directions for future study.

  + The success of overparameterization in modern machine learning has caused a paradigm shift in statistics.
  + In particular, the phenomenon of double descent, wherein model performance improves with model size far past the interpolation threshold, has upended the classical understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff.
  + Seeking tractable models in which to study this, statisticians have returned to the canonical problem of linear regression, though now under a high dimensional lens.
  + There, examining the effects of overparameterization in these simple models, they recover some hallmarks of double descent.
  + Throughout this literature, the assumption that the rows of the design are independent and identically distributed is ubiquitous – little is known about what may occur in settings of heavy dependence, which arise in, for example, neuroscience and finance.
  + Here, we instead model the design as right-rotationally invariant, a distribution permitting significant row dependence that has received recent attention.
  + Under this model, we derive the out-of-sample risks for minimum norm linear interpolation and ridge regression; furthermore, we prove that Generalized Cross Validation is no longer consistent, and offer a consistent alternative.
  + Lastly, we present partial findings on the random features model with Gaussian inputs and right-rotationally invariant weights, demonstrating numerical support for conjectures underlying our results.
